I have a few computers. Some of them have static IP addresses, but I don't remember what they are.

Sometimes I want to log in to one of my computers. Oops, I don't remember the address, or the DNS name, or anything about it really.

This program aims to solve this problem. Run the server application on one computer, hit a button, all your other computers reply.
The idea is that this program would give you their IP address, their name, and maybe eventually a small blurb about what it is running.

Are there about a hundred other programs you could use that look nicer? Yes, yes there are. I've used a few of the web dashboards before.
They work great, until I forget the IP address of the computer their on, or the port number where they are hosted. 1st world problems I know.
